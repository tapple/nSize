SECURITY TODO:
- SSL
- Require Token Auth for the LSL Gateway Registration, so other server's can't impersonate mine
- Change the auth for Outfit server to be compatable with Django token auth (Authorization Header, not query param)
- Require Token Auth for the delivery api so that people can't use it to spam others with inventory offers, or overload the in-world servers
